# Writer's Practice

> *"I went to the woods to live deliberately..."* â€” Practice typing the words that shaped literature.

A macOS-inspired typing practice tool designed specifically for writers who want to internalize the rhythm, style, and cadence of great literature through deliberate practice.

## The Art of Literary Copywork

This project is built on a centuries-old tradition practiced by master writers: **copywork** â€” the deliberate copying of great literature to internalize its rhythm, style, and structure.

### Historical Foundation

The practice of copying great writing has deep roots in literary history:

**Benjamin Franklin** (1706-1790) taught himself to write by copying articles from *The Spectator*. As a teenager, he would:
- Make notes on the key points of each sentence
- Wait several days for his memory to fade
- Rewrite the articles from his notes in his own words
- Compare his version to the original, learning from the differences

This systematic approach transformed Franklin from someone whose writing "fell far short in elegance of expression" into one of America's most persuasive writers.

**Modern Masters** continued this tradition:
- **Jack London** copied every page of Rudyard Kipling's works in longhand, believing it would fill his writing with Kipling's rhythms and phrases
- **Hunter S. Thompson** typed out entire pages of Hemingway's *For Whom the Bell Tolls* and Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby*
- **Steven Pressfield** copied Hemingway "to get into his head and understand how he constructed sentences"

### The Digital Evolution

While the masters used pen and paper, the digital age offers new possibilities. Typing allows for:
- **Faster practice** with longer passages
- **Real-time feedback** on accuracy and speed
- **Systematic tracking** of progress and improvement
- **Easy experimentation** with different authors and styles

This tool bridges the ancient practice with modern technology, making literary copywork accessible and engaging for contemporary writers.

- **Accuracy tracking** with color-coded performance indicators
- **Progress visualization** to maintain motivation

### ðŸŽ¨ **Writer-Focused Design**
- **macOS-inspired interface** with attention to typography and spacing
- **Dark/light mode** that respects system preferences
- **Distraction-free environment** that keeps focus on the text
- **Responsive design** that works beautifully on any screen size

### ðŸ’¾ **Personal Library**
- **Save custom texts** for repeated practice
- **Title and organize** your personal collection
- **Search and filter** through the complete library
- **Category-based browsing** by genre and difficulty

## The Practice

### Getting Started
1. **Choose Your Text**: Browse the library or add your own passage
2. **Focus and Type**: Click anywhere to begin, then type character-by-character
3. **Observe Feedback**: Green for correct, red for errors, blue for current position
4. **Track Progress**: Watch your WPM and accuracy improve over time

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **âŒ˜L** (Cmd+L): Load new text
- **âŒ˜R** (Cmd+R): Reset current passage
- **âŒ˜D** (Cmd+D): Toggle dark mode

### The Learning Process

As you type each character, you're not just building muscle memory â€” you're internalizing:
- **Sentence structure** and flow
- **Punctuation patterns** and rhythm
- **Word choice** and vocabulary
- **Stylistic nuances** that make great writing

The physical act of typing forces you to slow down and experience every word, every comma, every choice the author made.

## Philosophy

> *"Every great writer has imitated the great writers before him or her. To find your voice, you have to take on the voices of others."*

This tool embodies the belief that great writing is learned through intimate engagement with great texts. By typing the words of masters, character by character, you develop:

- **Muscle memory** for sophisticated sentence structures
- **Intuitive understanding** of rhythm and flow
- **Expanded vocabulary** integrated naturally into your writing
- **Confidence** in tackling complex literary constructions

The practice transforms reading from passive consumption to active apprenticeship.
